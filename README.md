# Introduction
  This is a sample set of code from my 'Innovation CoPilot', which I built for the Innovation practice area of the Boston Consulting Group. 
  Much of the code has been redacted and simplified in order to provide a simple 'starter' chatbot from which you can build a more complex chatbot for your use case!
  
  The full article with additional details and context can be found here: https://medium.com/@gbouslov/from-zero-to-genai-chatbot-hero-29b1f45f6542

### Prerequisites
  - Python (latest version)
  - Visual Studio Code or any code editor of your choice

  2. Make your desired changes
  3. Create a Streamlit Cloud account and connect it to your github using the instructions here: https://streamlit.io/cloud
  4. Host your chatbot and access it at the link of your choosing

### Features
  This version of the Innovation CoPilot is sanitized and includes four files: main.py, helper_functions.py, index_functions.py, setup_st.py
